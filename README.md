This is a boilerplate app to set up a website with only static pages.

It comes loaded with Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery.

New pages need to specify which layout to use in home_controller.rb
There is a private method to place the new page name with the appropriate layout.

These static pages will use the layout from '/views/layouts'.
