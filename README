This is a boilerplate app to set up a website with only static pages.

It comes loaded with Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery.

It uses [high_voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage) gem to do the static pages.  Just create a *.html.erb file in 'views/pages/' and you can link to it.  

These static pages will use the layout from '/views/layouts'.
